### Decimal To Binary
1. Divide the number by 2.
2. Get the integer quotient for the next iteration.
3. Get the remainder for the binary digit.
4. Repeat the steps until the quotient is equal to 0.

Example: 
|Divide by 2 	 | Quotient	  | Remainder	  | Bit #   |
|-------------:|-----------:|------------:|--------:|
|13/2	         | 6          |	1	          | 0       |
|6/2	         | 3	        | 0	          | 1       |
|3/2           |	 1        |	1	          | 2       |
|1/2	         | 0        	| 1           |	3       |
