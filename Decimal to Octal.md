# Converting Decimal Numbers to Other Number Systems

### Decimal To Octal
1. Divide the number by 8.
2. Get the integer quotient for the next iteration.
3. Get the remainder for the octal digit.
4. Repeat the steps until the quotient is equal to 0.
5. Put the numbers together in reverse order. Include zeros.

Example: Starting with the decimal number **1792**:
| Decimal Number | Operation  | Quotient | Remainder | Octal Number |
|----------------|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| 1792           | รท 8        | 224      | 0         | 0            |
| 224            | รท 8        | 28       | 0         | 00           |
| 28             | รท 8        | 3        | 4         | 400          |
| 3              | รท 8        | 0        | 3         | 3400         |

Your binary number is **3400**
